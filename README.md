# `two_claps_open` 👏
Open Chrome (or any file/app) by simply clapping twice — just like [Tony Stark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT2b5KzMoC0&t=101s).

#### 🔸Open a presentation slide and chrome by clapping twice (two_claps_open.py)

## Clap Detection
To figure out what a clap "looks like" in terms of sound, I first recorded a sample clap and ran a Fourier transform on it to check the frequency content.
From the analysis, most of the energy from the clap is concentrated around 1.4kHz to 1.8kHz. 
Based on this, I set up a bandpass filter to isolate only that range and ignore irrelevant noise.
After filtering, I used peak detection to recognize when a clap happens in real time. (see figure below)
Once two peaks (claps) are detected with some minimum spacing, the system launches Chrome (or any command you define).
